The Shotgun fires wide volleys of shots, capable of damaging multiple targets at once or eviscerating single targets. However, it requires more time to reload than the Pistol, and its shots cannot travel as far. The Shotgunâ€™s recoil can be used to boost yourself through the air, enabling you to reach new heights.

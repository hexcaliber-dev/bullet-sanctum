Youâ€™ve been out of action for quite a while. When you last tried to defend the sanctum, the forces of Hell proved too numerous and unrelenting to fend off. Now they have overrun this holy place, instilling corruption wherever they wander.
This is your second chance to right your wrongs. In the name of all that is sacred, do not fail again, Crusader.
